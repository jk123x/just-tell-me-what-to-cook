Problem
People don’t know what to cook with random supplies and low energy. Existing apps assume high organisation.

User stories

As a low-energy user, I can snap a photo of what I have and get 1–3 realistic meal options.

As a tired user, I can speak what I have + my energy level and get a simple plan.

As a messy user, I can quickly remove wrong ingredients and add missing ones.

Core flow
Input → Extracted ingredient chips (editable) → Energy selector → Suggestions (max 3) → Refine loop.

V1 constraints
No accounts. No pantry tracking. No recipe browsing library.

Acceptance criteria

Mobile camera upload works.

Voice record + transcription works (at least in Chrome/Safari mobile, or provide fallback).

User can edit ingredient chips before suggestions.

Suggestions reflect energy level (fewer steps, fewer dishes).

App avoids generic template UI; generous spacing; intentional typography; casual AU microcopy.

README includes setup + env vars.
